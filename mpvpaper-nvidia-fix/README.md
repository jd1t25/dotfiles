## Installers 
### Arch Based:

### Gentoo:
GURU package: https://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/guru/gui-apps/mpvpaper/

## Usage
### Running
Simple example:
```
mpvpaper DP-2 /path/to/video
```
You can also forward mpv options by passing "--mpv-options" or "-o" like so:
```
mpvpaper -o "no-audio --loop-playlist shuffle" HDMI-A-1 www.url/to/playlist
```
### Controlling
If MPVPaper is running in a terminal and is not forked:

Simply enter your keyboard key bindings directly into the terminal.

Else if you would like to control MPVPaper while it's forked, use a mpv input-ipc-server like this:
```
mpvpaper -o "input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpv-socket" DP-1 /path/to/video
```
Then input commands with socat. For example, toggle pause:
```
echo 'cycle pause' | socat - /tmp/mpv-socket
```
For more commands read: https://mpv.io/manual/master/#command-interface
## Notes
If you are on sway, you can get your display outputs with:
```
swaymsg -t get_outputs
```
And make sure you don't let swaybg stand in your way:
```
killall swaybg
```
