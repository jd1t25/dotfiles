/ Then even nothingness was not, nor      \
| existence, There was no air then, nor   |
| the heavens beyond it. What covered it? |
| Where was it? In whose keeping Was      |
| there then cosmic water, in depths      |
| unfathomed?                             |
|                                         |
| Then there was neither death nor        |
| immortality Nor was there then the      |
| torch of night and day. The One         |
| breathed windlessly and                 |
| self-sustaining. There was that One     |
| then, and there was no other.           |
|                                         |
| At first there was only darkness        |
| wrapped in darkness. All this was only  |
| unillumined water. That One which came  |
| to be, enclosed in nothing, arose at    |
| last, born of the power of heat.        |
|                                         |
| In the beginning desire descended on    |
| it. That was the primal seed, born of   |
| the mind. The sages who have searched   |
| their hearts with wisdom know that      |
| which is kin to that which is not.      |
|                                         |
| And they have stretched their cord      |
| across the void, and know what was      |
| above, and what below. Seminal powers   |
| made fertile mighty forces. Below was   |
| strength, and over it was impulse.      |
|                                         |
| But, after all, who knows, and who can  |
| say Whence it all came, and how         |
| creation happened? The gods themselves  |
| are later than creation, so who knows   |
| truly whence it has arisen?             |
|                                         |
| Whence all creation had its origin, he, |
| whether he fashioned it or whether he   |
| did not, he, who surveys it all from    |
| highest heaven, he knows - or maybe     |
\ even he does not know.                  /
